If a good cause extension is granted, then the revised application must be received by the end of the extension period.</P>
          <P>(3) The National Coordinator is permitted up to 15 days to review a revised application once it has been received and may request clarification of statements and the correction of errors or omissions in a revised application during this time period.</P>
          <P>(4) If the National Coordinator determines that a revised application still contains deficiencies, the applicant will be issued a denial notice indicating that the applicant will no longer be considered for authorization under the temporary certification program. An applicant may request reconsideration of a denial in accordance with § 170.435.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Satisfactory application.</E> (1) An application will be deemed satisfactory if it meets all application requirements, including a passing score on the proficiency examination.</P>
          <P>(2) The National Coordinator will notify the applicant's authorized representative of its satisfactory application and its successful achievement of ONC-ATCB status.</P>

          <P>(3) Once notified by the National Coordinator of its successful achievement <PRTPAGE P="918"/>of ONC-ATCB status, the applicant may represent itself as an ONC-ATCB and begin testing and certifying Complete EHRs and/or EHR Modules consistent with its authorization.</P>

          <P>(a) An applicant may request that the National Coordinator reconsider a denial notice issued for each part of an application only if the applicant can demonstrate that clear, factual errors were made in the review of the applicable part of the application and that the errors' correction could lead to the applicant obtaining ONC-ATCB status.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Submission requirement.</E> An applicant is required to submit, within 15 days of receipt of a denial notice, a written statement to the National Coordinator contesting the decision to deny its application and explaining with sufficient documentation what factual errors it believes can account for the denial. If the National Coordinator does not receive the applicant's submission within the specified timeframe, its reconsideration request may be rejected.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Reconsideration request review.</E> If the National Coordinator receives a timely reconsideration request, the National Coordinator is permitted up to 15 days from the date of receipt to review the information submitted by the applicant and issue a decision.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Decision.</E> (1) If the National Coordinator determines that clear, factual errors were made during the review of the application and that correction of the errors would remove all identified deficiencies, the applicant's authorized representative will be notified of the National Coordinator's decision to reverse the previous decision(s) not to approve part of the applicant's application or the entire application.</P>
          <P>(i) If the National Coordinator's decision to reverse the previous decision(s) affected part 1 of an application, the National Coordinator will subsequently review part 2 of the application.</P>
          <P>(ii) If the National Coordinator's decision to reverse the previous decision(s) affected part 2 of an application, the applicant's authorized representative will be notified of the National Coordinator's decision as well as the applicant's successful achievement of ONC-ATCB status.</P>
          <P>(2) If, after reviewing an applicant's reconsideration request, the National Coordinator determines that the applicant did not identify any factual errors or that correction of those factual errors would not remove all identified deficiencies in the application, the National Coordinator may reject the applicant's reconsideration request.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Effect of revocation on the certifications issued to Complete EHRs and EHR Module(s).</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) The certified status of Complete EHRs and/or EHR Module(s) certified by an ONC-ACB that had its status revoked will remain intact unless a Type-1 violation was committed that calls into question the legitimacy of the certifications issued by the former ONC-ACB.</P>
          <P>(b) If the National Coordinator determines that a Type-1 violation occurred that called into question the legitimacy of certifications conducted by the former ONC-ACB, then the National Coordinator would:</P>
          <P>(1) Review the facts surrounding the revocation of the ONC-ACB's status; and</P>
          <P>(2) Publish a notice on ONC's Web site if the National Coordinator believes that Complete EHRs and/or EHR Module(s) were improperly certified by the former ONC-ACB.</P>
          <P>(c) If the National Coordinator determines that Complete EHRs and/or EHR Module(s) were improperly certified, the certification status of affected Complete EHRs and/or EHR Module(s) would only remain intact for 120 days after the National Coordinator publishes the notice. The certification status of affected Complete EHRs and/or EHR Module(s) can only be maintained thereafter by being re-certified by an ONC-ACB in good standing.</P>
