can account for the denial. If the National Coordinator does not receive 
the applicant's submission within the specified timeframe, its 
reconsideration request may be rejected.
    (c) Reconsideration request review. If the National Coordinator 
receives a timely reconsideration request, the National Coordinator is 
permitted up to 15 days from the date of receipt to review the 
information submitted by the applicant and issue a decision.
    (d) Decision. (1) If the National Coordinator determines that clear, 
factual errors were made during the review of the application and that 
correction of the errors would remove all identified deficiencies, the 
applicant's authorized representative will be notified of the National 
Coordinator's decision to reverse the previous decision(s) not to 
approve part of the applicant's application or the entire application.
    (i) If the National Coordinator's decision to reverse the previous 
decision(s) affected part 1 of an application, the National Coordinator 
will subsequently review part 2 of the application.
    (ii) If the National Coordinator's decision to reverse the previous 
decision(s) affected part 2 of an application, the applicant's 
authorized representative will be notified of the National Coordinator's 
decision as well as the applicant's successful achievement of ONC-ATCB 
status.
    (2) If, after reviewing an applicant's reconsideration request, the 
National Coordinator determines that the applicant did not identify any 
factual errors or that correction of those factual errors would not 
remove all identified deficiencies in the application, the National 
Coordinator may reject the applicant's reconsideration request.
    (3) Final decision. A reconsideration decision issued by the 
National Coordinator is final and not subject to further review.



Sec. 170.440  ONC-ATCB status.

    (a) Acknowledgement and publication. The National Coordinator will 
acknowledge and make publicly available the names of ONC-ATCBs, 
including the date each was authorized and the type(s) of testing and 
certification each has been authorized to perform.

temporary certification program.
    (d) Expiration. The status of all ONC-ATCBs will expire upon the 
sunset of the temporary certification program in accordance with Sec. 
170.490.



Sec. 170.445  Complete EHR testing and certification.

    (a) An ONC-ATCB must test and certify Complete EHRs to all 
applicable certification criteria adopted by the Secretary at subpart C 
of this part.
    (b) An ONC-ATCB must provide the option for a Complete EHR to be 
tested and certified solely to the applicable certification criteria 
adopted by the Secretary at subpart C of this part.
    (c) Inherited certified status. An ONC-ATCB must accept requests for 
a newer version of a previously certified Complete EHR to inherit the 
previously certified Complete EHR's certified status without requiring 
the newer version to be retested and recertified.



    (1) Before granting certified status to a newer version of a 
previously certified Complete EHR, an ONC-ATCB must review an 
attestation submitted by the developer of the Complete EHR to determine 
whether the newer version has adversely affected any previously 
certified capabilities.
    (2) An ONC-ATCB may grant certified status to a newer version of a 
previously certified Complete EHR if it determines that previously 
certified capabilities have not been adversely affected.
    (d) An ONC-ATCB that has been authorized to test and certify 
Complete EHRs is also authorized to test and certify all EHR Modules 
under the temporary certification program.



Sec. 170.450  EHR module testing and certification.

    (a) When testing and certifying EHR Modules, an ONC-ATCB must test 
and certify in accordance with the applicable certification criterion or 
certification criteria adopted by the Secretary at subpart C of this 
part.
    (b) An ONC-ATCB must provide the option for an EHR Module or a 
bundle of EHR Modules to be tested and certified solely to the 
applicable certification criteria adopted by the Secretary at subpart C 
of this part.
    (c) Privacy and security testing and certification. EHR Modules 
shall be tested and certified to all privacy and security certification 
criteria adopted by the Secretary unless the EHR Module(s) is/are 
presented for testing and certification in one of the following manners:
    (1) The EHR Module(s) is/are presented for testing and certification 
as a pre-coordinated, integrated bundle of EHR Modules, which would 
otherwise meet the definition of and constitute a Complete EHR (as 
defined in 45 CFR 170.102), and one or more of the constituent EHR 
Modules is/are demonstrably responsible for providing all of the privacy 
and security capabilities for the entire bundle of EHR Module(s); or
    (2) An EHR Module is presented for testing and certification, and 
the presenter can demonstrate and provide documentation to the ONC-ATCB 
that a privacy and security certification criterion is inapplicable or 
that it would be technically infeasible for the EHR Module to be tested 
and certified in accordance with such certification criterion.
    (d) Inherited certified status. An ONC-ATCB must accept requests for 
a newer version of a previously certified EHR Module or bundle of EHR 
Modules to inherit the previously certified EHR Module's or bundle of 
EHR Modules certified status without requiring the newer version to be 
retested and recertified.
    (1) Before granting certified status to a newer version of a 
previously certified EHR Module or bundle of EHR Modules, an ONC-ATCB 
must review an attestation submitted by the developer of the EHR Module 
or presenter of the bundle of EHR Modules to determine whether the newer 
version has adversely affected any previously certified capabilities.
    (2) An ONC-ATCB may grant certified status to a newer version of a 
previously certified EHR Module or bundle of EHR Modules if it 
determines that previously certified capabilities have not been 
adversely affected.

subpart B of this part if the Secretary has accepted a newer version of 
an adopted minimum standard.
    (b) Applicability of an accepted new version of an adopted minimum 
standard.
    (1) ONC-ATCBs are not required to test and certify Complete EHRs 
and/or EHR Modules according to newer versions of an adopted minimum 
standard accepted by the Secretary until the incorporation by reference 
provision of the adopted version is updated in the Federal Register with 
a newer version.
    (2) Certified EHR Technology may be upgraded to comply with newer 
versions of an adopted minimum standard accepted by the Secretary 
without adversely affecting the certification



status of the Certified EHR Technology.



Sec. 170.457  Authorized testing and certification methods.

    An ONC-ATCB must provide remote testing and certification for both 
development and deployment sites.



Sec. 170.460  Good standing as an ONC-ATCB.

    An ONC-ATCB must maintain good standing by:
    (a) Adhering to the Principles of Proper Conduct for ONC-ATCBs;
    (b) Refraining from engaging in other types of inappropriate 
behavior, including an ONC-ATCB misrepresenting the scope of its 
authorization as well as an ONC-ATCB testing and certifying Complete 
EHRs and/or EHR Modules for which it does not have authorization; and
    (c) Following all other applicable Federal and state laws.



Sec. 170.465  Revocation of authorized testing and certification body status.

    (a) Type-1 violations. The National Coordinator may revoke an ONC-
ATCB's status for committing a Type-1 violation. Type-1 violations 
include violations of law or temporary certification program policies 
that threaten or significantly undermine the integrity of the temporary 
certification program. These violations include, but are not limited to: 
False, fraudulent, or abusive activities that affect the temporary 
certification program, a program administered by HHS or any program 
administered by the Federal government.
    (b) Type-2 violations. The National Coordinator may revoke an ONC-
ATCB's status for failing to timely or adequately correct a Type-2 
violation. Type-2 violations constitute noncompliance with Sec. 
170.460.
    (1) Noncompliance notification. If the National Coordinator obtains 
reliable evidence that an ONC-ATCB may no longer be in compliance with 
Sec. 170.460, the National Coordinator will issue a noncompliance 
notification with reasons for the notification to the ONC-ATCB 
requesting that the ONC-ATCB respond to the alleged violation and 
correct the violation, if applicable.
    (2) Opportunity to become compliant. After receipt of a 
noncompliance notification, an ONC-ATCB is permitted up to 30 days to 
submit a written response and accompanying documentation that 
demonstrates that no violation occurred or that the alleged violation 
has been corrected.
    (i) If the ONC-ATCB submits a response, the National Coordinator is 
permitted up to 30 days from the time the response is received to 
evaluate the response and reach a decision. The National Coordinator 
may, if necessary, request additional information from the ONC-ATCB 
during this time period.
    (ii) If the National Coordinator determines that no violation 
occurred or that the violation has been sufficiently corrected, the 
National Coordinator will issue a memo to the ONC-ATCB confirming this 
determination.
    (iii) If the National Coordinator determines that the ONC-ATCB 
failed to demonstrate that no violation occurred or to correct the 
area(s) of non-compliance identified under paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section within 30 days of receipt of the noncompliance notification, 
then the National Coordinator may propose to revoke the ONC-ATCB's 
status.
    (c) Proposed revocation. (1) The National Coordinator may propose to 
revoke an ONC-ATCB's status if the National Coordinator has reliable 
evidence that the ONC-ATCB committed a Type-1 violation; or
    (2) The National Coordinator may propose to revoke an ONC-ATCB's 
status if, after the ONC-ATCB has been notified of a Type-2 violation, 
the ONC-ATCB fails to:
    (i) To rebut the finding of a violation with sufficient evidence 
showing that the violation did not occur or that the violation has been 
corrected; or
    (ii) Submit to the National Coordinator a written response to the 
noncompliance notification within the specified timeframe under 
paragraph (b)(2).
    (d) Suspension of an ONC-ATCB's operations. (1) The National 
Coordinator may suspend the operations of an ONC-



ATCB under the temporary certification program based on reliable 
evidence indicating that:
    (i) The ONC-ATCB committed a Type-1 or Type-2 violation; and
    (ii) The continued testing and certification of Complete EHRs and/or 
EHR Modules by the ONC-ATCB could have an adverse impact on the health 
or safety of patients.
    (2) If the National Coordinator determines that the conditions of 
paragraph (d)(1) have been met, an ONC-ATCB will be issued a notice of 
proposed suspension.
    (3) Upon receipt of a notice of proposed suspension, an ONC-ATCB 
will be permitted up to 3 days to submit a written response to the 
National Coordinator explaining why its operations should not be 
suspended.
    (4) The National Coordinator is permitted up to 5 days from receipt 
of an ONC-ATCB's written response to a notice of proposed suspension to 
review the response and make a determination.
    (5) The National Coordinator may make one of the following 
determinations in response to the ONC-ATCB's written response or if the 
ONC-ATCB fails to submit a written response within the timeframe 
specified in paragraph (d)(3):
    (i) Rescind the proposed suspension; or
    (ii) Suspend the ONC-ATCB's operations until it has adequately 
corrected a Type-2 violation; or
    (iii) Propose revocation in accordance with Sec. 170.465(c) and 
suspend the ONC-ATCB's operations for the duration of the revocation 
process.
    (6) A suspension will become effective upon an ONC-ATCB's receipt of 
a notice of suspension.
    (e) Opportunity to respond to a proposed revocation notice. (1) An 
ONC-ATCB may respond to a proposed revocation notice, but must do so 
within 10 days of receiving the proposed revocation notice and include 
appropriate documentation explaining in writing why its status should 
not be revoked.
    (2) Upon receipt of an ONC-ATCB's response to a proposed revocation 
notice, the National Coordinator is permitted up to 30 days to review 
the information submitted by the ONC-ATCB and reach a decision.
    (3) Unless suspended, an ONC-ATCB will be permitted to continue its 
operations under the temporary certification program during the time 
period provided for the ONC-ATCB to respond to the proposed revocation 
notice and the National Coordinator to review the response.
    (f) Good standing determination. If the National Coordinator 
determines that an ONC-ATCB's status should not be revoked, the National 
Coordinator will notify the ONC-ATCB's authorized representative in 
writing of this determination.
    (g) Revocation. (1) The National Coordinator may revoke an ONC-
ATCB's status if:
    (i) A determination is made that revocation is appropriate after 
considering the information provided by the ONC-ATCB in response to the 
proposed revocation notice; or
    (ii) The ONC-ATCB does not respond to a proposed revocation notice 
within the specified timeframe in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
    (2) A decision to revoke an ONC-ATCB's status is final and not 
subject to further review unless the National Coordinator chooses to 
reconsider the revocation.
    (h) Extent and duration of revocation. (1) The revocation of an ONC-
ATCB is effective as soon as the ONC-ATCB receives the revocation 
notice.
    (2) A testing and certification body that has had its ONC-ATCB 
status revoked is prohibited from accepting new requests for testing and 
certification and must cease its current testing and certification 
operations under the temporary certification program.
    (3) A testing and certification body that has had its ONC-ATCB 
status revoked for a Type-1 violation is prohibited from reapplying for 
ONC-ATCB status under the temporary certification program for one year. 
If the temporary certification program sunsets during this time, the 
testing and certification body is prohibited from applying for ONC-ACB 
status under the permanent certification program for the time that 
remains within the one year prohibition.



    (4) The failure of a testing and certification body that has had its 
ONC-ATCB status revoked, to promptly refund any and all fees for tests 
and/or certifications of Complete EHRs and EHR Modules not completed 
will be considered a violation of the Principles of Proper Conduct for 
ONC-ATCBs and will be taken into account by the National Coordinator if 
the testing and certification body reapplies for ONC-ATCB status under 
the temporary certification program or applies for ONC-ACB status under 
the permanent certification program.



Sec. 170.470  Effect of revocation on the certifications issued to complete 

EHRs and EHR Modules.

    (a) The certified status of Complete EHRs and/or EHR Modules 
certified by an ONC-ATCB that had it status revoked will remain intact 
unless a Type-1 violation was committed that calls into question the 
legitimacy of the certifications issued by the former ONC-ATCB.
    (b) If the National Coordinator determines that a Type-1 violation 
occurred that called into question the legitimacy of certifications 
conducted by the former ONC-ATCB, then the National Coordinator would:
    (1) Review the facts surrounding the revocation of the ONC-ATCB's 
status; and
    (2) Publish a notice on ONC's Web site if the National Coordinator 
believes that Complete EHRs and/or EHR Modules were improperly certified 
by the former ONC-ATCB.
    (c) If the National Coordinator determines that Complete EHRs and/or 
EHR Modules were improperly certified, the certification status of 
affected Complete EHRs and/or EHR Modules would only remain intact for 
120 days after the National Coordinator publishes the notice. The 
certification status of the Complete EHR and/or EHR Module can only be 
maintained thereafter by being re-certified by an ONC-ATCB in good 
standing.



Sec. 170.490  Sunset of the temporary certification program.

    (a) The temporary certification program will sunset on December 31, 
2011, or if the permanent certification program is not fully constituted 
at that time, then upon a subsequent date that is determined to be 
appropriate by the National Coordinator. On and after the temporary 
certification program sunset date, ONC-ATCBs will be prohibited from 
accepting new requests to test and certify Complete EHRs or EHR Modules.
    (b) ONC-ATCBs are permitted up to six months after the sunset date 
to complete all testing and certification activities associated with 
requests for testing and certification of Complete EHRs and/or EHR 
Modules received prior to the sunset date.

Sec. 170.500  Basis and scope.

    This subpart implements section 3001(c)(5) of the Public Health 
Service Act and sets forth the rules and procedures related to the 
permanent certification program for health information technology (HIT) 
administered by the National Coordinator for Health Information 
Technology.



Sec. 170.501  Applicability.

    This subpart establishes the processes that applicants for ONC-ACB 
status must follow to be granted ONC-ACB status by the National 
Coordinator; the processes the National Coordinator will follow when 
assessing applicants and granting ONC-ACB status; the requirements that 
ONC-ACBs must follow to maintain ONC-ACB status; and the requirements of 
ONC-ACBs for certifying Complete EHRs, EHR Module(s), and other types of 
HIT in accordance with the applicable certification criteria adopted by 
the Secretary in subpart C of this part. It also establishes the 
processes accreditation organizations must follow to request approval 
from the National Coordinator and that the National Coordinator in turn 
will follow to approve an accreditation organization under the permanent 
certification program as well as certain ongoing responsibilities for an 
ONC-AA.



Sec. 170.502  Definitions.

    For the purposes of this subpart:
    Applicant means a single organization or a consortium of

the use of consistent, objective, valid, and reliable methods;



    (3) Verify that ONC-ACBs are performing surveillance in accordance 
with their respective annual plans; and
    (4) Review ONC-ACB surveillance results to determine if the results 
indicate any substantive non-conformance by ONC-ACBs with the conditions 
of their respective accreditations.
    (f) ONC-AA status.
    (1) An accreditation organization has not been granted ONC-AA status 
unless and until it is notified by the National Coordinator that it has 
been approved as the ONC-AA on a final basis pursuant to paragraph (d)

to review an application that is submitted for the first time.
    (b) Application deficiencies.
    (1) If the National Coordinator identifies an area in an application 
that requires the applicant to clarify a statement or correct an error 
or omission, the National Coordinator may contact the applicant to make 
such clarification or correction without issuing a deficiency notice. If 
the National Coordinator has not received the requested information 
after five days, the National Coordinator may issue a deficiency notice 
to the applicant.
    (2) If the National Coordinator determines that deficiencies in the 
application exist, the National Coordinator will issue a deficiency 
notice to the applicant and return the application. The deficiency 
notice will identify the areas of the application that require 
additional information or correction.
    (c) Revised application.
    (1) An applicant is permitted to submit a revised application in 
response to a deficiency notice. An applicant may request from the 
National Coordinator an extension for good cause of the 15-day period 
provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section to submit a revised 
application.
    (2) In order for an applicant to continue to be considered for ONC-
ACB status, the applicant's revised application must address the 
specified deficiencies and be received by the National Coordinator 
within 15 days of the applicant's receipt of the deficiency notice, 
unless the National Coordinator grants an applicant's request for an 
extension of the 15-day period based on a finding of good cause. If a 
good cause extension is granted, then the revised application must be 
received by the end of the extension period.
    (3) The National Coordinator is permitted up to 15 days to review a 
revised application once it has been received and may request 
clarification of statements and the correction of errors or omissions in 
a revised application during this time period.



    (4) If the National Coordinator determines that a revised 
application still contains deficiencies, the applicant will be issued a

ONC-ACB and begin certifying health information technology consistent 
with its authorization.



Sec. 170.535  ONC-ACB application reconsideration.

    (a) An applicant may request that the National Coordinator 
reconsider a denial notice only if the applicant can demonstrate that 
clear, factual errors were made in the review of its application and 
that the errors' correction could lead to the applicant obtaining ONC-
ACB status.
    (b) Submission requirement. An applicant is required to submit, 
within 15 days of receipt of a denial notice, a written statement to the 
National Coordinator contesting the decision to deny its application and 
explaining with sufficient documentation what factual error(s) it 
believes can account for the denial. If the National Coordinator does 
not receive the applicant's reconsideration request within the specified 
timeframe, its reconsideration request may be rejected.
    (c) Reconsideration request review. If the National Coordinator 
receives a timely reconsideration request, the National Coordinator is 
permitted up to 15 days from the date of receipt to review the 
information submitted by the applicant and issue a decision.
    (d) Decision.
    (1) If the National Coordinator determines that clear, factual 
errors were made during the review of the application and that 
correction of the errors would remove all identified deficiencies, the 
applicant's authorized representative will be notified of the National 
Coordinator's determination and the applicant's successful achievement 
of ONC-ACB status.
    (2) If, after reviewing an applicant's reconsideration request, the 
National Coordinator determines that the applicant did not identify 
factual errors or that the correction of the factual errors would not 
remove all identified deficiencies in the application, the National 
Coordinator may reject the applicant's reconsideration request.
    (3) Final decision. A reconsideration decision issued by the 
National Coordinator is final and not subject to further review.

    (a) When certifying Complete EHRs, an ONC-ACB must certify in 
accordance with all applicable certification



criteria adopted by the Secretary at subpart C of this part.
    (b) An ONC-ACB must provide the option for a Complete EHR to be 
certified solely to the applicable certification criteria adopted by the 
Secretary at subpart C of this part.
    (c) Gap certification. An ONC-ACB may provide the option for and 
perform gap certification of previously certified Complete EHRs.
    (d) Inherited certified status. An ONC-ACB must accept requests for 
a newer version of a previously certified Complete EHR to inherit the 
certified status of the previously certified Complete EHR without 
requiring the newer version to be recertified.
    (1) Before granting certified status to a newer version of a 
previously certified Complete EHR, an ONC-ACB must review an attestation 
submitted by the developer of the Complete EHR to determine whether any 
change in the newer version has adversely affected the Complete EHR's 
capabilities for which certification criteria have been adopted.
    (2) An ONC-ACB may grant certified status to a newer version of a 
previously certified Complete EHR if it determines that the capabilities 
for which certification criteria have been adopted have not been 
adversely affected.
    (e) An ONC-ACB that has been authorized to certify Complete EHRs is 
also authorized to certify all EHR Modules under the permanent 
certification program.



Sec. 170.550  EHR Module certification.

perform gap certification of previously certified EHR Module(s).
    (d) An ONC-ACB may provide an updated certification to a previously 
certified EHR Module(s).
    (e) Privacy and security certification. EHR Module(s) shall be 
certified to all privacy and security certification criteria adopted by 
the Secretary, unless the EHR Module(s) is presented for certification 
in one of the following manners:
    (1) The EHR Modules are presented for certification as a pre-
coordinated, integrated bundle of EHR Modules, which would otherwise 
meet the definition of and constitute a Complete EHR, and one or more of 
the constituent EHR Modules is demonstrably responsible for providing 
all of the privacy and security capabilities for the entire bundle of 
EHR Modules; or
    (2) An EHR Module is presented for certification, and the presenter 
can demonstrate and provide documentation to the ONC-ACB that a privacy 
and security certification criterion is inapplicable or that it would be 
technically infeasible for the EHR Module to be certified in accordance 
with such certification criterion.
    (f) Inherited certified status. An ONC-ACB must accept requests for 
a newer version of a previously certified EHR Module(s) to inherit the 
certified status of the previously certified EHR Module(s) without 
requiring the newer version to be recertified.
    (1) Before granting certified status to a newer version of a 
previously certified EHR Module(s), an ONC-ACB must review an 
attestation submitted by the developer(s) of the EHR Module(s) to 
determine whether any change in the newer version has adversely affected 
the EHR Module(s)' capabilities for which certification criteria have 
been adopted.
    (2) An ONC-ACB may grant certified status to a newer version of a 
previously certified EHR Module(s) if it determines that the 
capabilities for which certification criteria have been adopted have not 
been adversely affected.

information technology in accordance with the



applicable certification criterion or certification criteria adopted by 
the Secretary at subpart C of this part.



Sec. 170.555  Certification to newer versions of certain standards.

    (a) ONC-ACBs may certify Complete EHRs and/or EHR Module(s) to a 
newer version of certain identified minimum standards specified at 
subpart B of this part if the Secretary has accepted a newer version of 
an adopted minimum standard.
    (b) Applicability of an accepted newer version of an adopted minimum 
standard.
    (1) ONC-ACBs are not required to certify Complete EHRs and/or EHR 
Module(s) according to newer versions of an adopted minimum standard 
accepted by the Secretary until the incorporation by reference provision 
of the adopted version is updated in the Federal Register with a newer 
version.
    (2) Certified EHR Technology may be upgraded to comply with newer 
versions of an adopted minimum standard accepted by the Secretary 
without adversely affecting the certification status of the Certified 
EHR Technology.



Sec. 170.557  Authorized certification methods.

    An ONC-ACB must provide remote certification for both development 
and deployment sites.

    (a) Adhering to the Principles of Proper Conduct for ONC-ACBs;
    (b) Refraining from engaging in other types of inappropriate 
behavior, including an ONC-ACB misrepresenting the scope of its 
authorization, as well as an ONC-ACB certifying Complete EHRs and/or EHR 
Module(s) for which it does not have authorization; and
    (c) Following all other applicable Federal and State laws.



Sec. 170.565  Revocation of ONC-ACB status.

    (a) Type-1 violations. The National Coordinator may revoke an ONC-
ACB's status for committing a Type-1 violation. Type-1 violations 
include violations of law or permanent certification program policies 
that threaten or significantly undermine the integrity of the permanent 
certification program. These violations include, but are not limited to: 
False, fraudulent, or abusive activities that affect the permanent 
certification program, a program administered by HHS or any program 
administered by the Federal government.
    (b) Type-2 violations. The National Coordinator may revoke an ONC-
ACB's status for failing to timely or adequately correct a Type-2

noncompliance notification within the specified timeframe under 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (d) Suspension of an ONC-ACB's operations.
    (1) The National Coordinator may suspend the operations of an ONC-
ACB under the permanent certification program based on reliable evidence 
indicating that:
    (i) The ONC-ACB committed a Type-1 or Type-2 violation; and
    (ii) The continued certification of Complete EHRs, EHR Module(s), 
and/or other types of HIT by the ONC-ACB could have an adverse impact on 
the health or safety of patients.
    (2) If the National Coordinator determines that the conditions of 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section have been met, an ONC-ACB will be 
issued a notice of proposed suspension.
    (3) Upon receipt of a notice of proposed suspension, an ONC-ACB will 
be permitted up to 3 days to submit a written response to the National 
Coordinator explaining why its operations should not be suspended.
    (4) The National Coordinator is permitted up to 5 days from receipt 
of an ONC-ACB's written response to a notice of proposed suspension to 
review the response and make a determination.
    (5) The National Coordinator may make one of the following 
determinations in response to the ONC-ACB's written response or if the 
ONC-ACB fails to submit a written response within the timeframe 
specified in paragraph (d)(3) of this section:
    (i) Rescind the proposed suspension; or
    (ii) Suspend the ONC-ACB's operations until it has adequately 
corrected a Type-2 violation; or
    (iii) Propose revocation in accordance with Sec. 170.565(c) and 
suspend the ONC-ACB's operations for the duration of the revocation 
process.
    (6) A suspension will become effective upon an ONC-ACB's receipt of 
a notice of suspension.
    (e) Opportunity to respond to a proposed revocation notice.
    (1) An ONC-ACB may respond to a proposed revocation notice, but must 
do so within 10 days of receiving the proposed revocation notice and

determines that an ONC-ACB's status should not be revoked, the National 
Coordinator will notify the ONC-ACB's authorized representative in 
writing of this determination.
    (g) Revocation.
    (1) The National Coordinator may revoke an ONC-ACB's status if:
    (i) A determination is made that revocation is appropriate after 
considering the information provided by the ONC-ACB in response to the 
proposed revocation notice; or
    (ii) The ONC-ACB does not respond to a proposed revocation notice 
within the specified timeframe in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
    (2) A decision to revoke an ONC-ACB's status is final and not 
subject to further review unless the National Coordinator chooses to 
reconsider the revocation.
    (h) Extent and duration of revocation.
    (1) The revocation of an ONC-ACB is effective as soon as the ONC-ACB 
receives the revocation notice.
    (2) A certification body that has had its ONC-ACB status revoked is 
prohibited from accepting new requests for



certification and must cease its current certification operations under 
the permanent certification program.
    (3) A certification body that has had its ONC-ACB has its status 
revoked for a Type-1 violation, is not permitted to reapply for ONC-ACB 
status under the permanent certification program for a period of 1 year.
    (4) The failure of a certification body that has had its ONC-ACB 
status revoked to promptly refund any and all fees for certifications of 
Complete EHRs and EHR Module(s) not completed will be considered a 
violation of the Principles of Proper Conduct for ONC-ACBs and will be 
taken into account by the National Coordinator if the certification body 
reapplies for ONC-ACB status under the permanent certification program.



Sec. 170.570  Effect of revocation on the certifications issued to Complete 

EHRs and EHR Module(s).

    (a) The certified status of Complete EHRs and/or EHR Module(s) 
certified by an ONC-ACB that had its status revoked will remain intact 
unless a Type-1 violation was committed that calls into question the 
legitimacy of the certifications issued by the former ONC-ACB.
    (b) If the National Coordinator determines that a Type-1 violation 
occurred that called into question the legitimacy of certifications 
conducted by the former ONC-ACB, then the National Coordinator would:
    (1) Review the facts surrounding the revocation of the ONC-ACB's 
status; and
    (2) Publish a notice on ONC's Web site if the National Coordinator 
believes that Complete EHRs and/or EHR Module(s) were improperly 
certified by the former ONC-ACB.
    (c) If the National Coordinator determines that Complete EHRs and/or 
EHR Module(s) were improperly certified, the certification status of 
affected Complete EHRs and/or EHR Module(s) would only remain intact for 
120 days after the National Coordinator publishes the notice. The 
certification status of affected Complete EHRs and/or EHR Module(s) can 
only be maintained thereafter by being re-certified by an ONC-ACB in 
good standing.
